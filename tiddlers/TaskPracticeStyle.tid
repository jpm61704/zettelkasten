In this [[style of teaching|StylesOfTeaching(Skiing)]], as opposed to the [[command style|CommandStyle]], the instructor shares execution decisions with the students. The instructor will still take the lead to explain and demonstrate, as in [[command style|CommandStyle]]. They will also set some boundaries for time, safety, and space, but then turn the students loose to practice on their own. The job of the instructor then becomes visiting each student(on their own turf) to provide feedback. This style excels at letting students learn at their own pace.
