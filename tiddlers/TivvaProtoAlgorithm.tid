To get the sub-definitions of [[Reprovable]], we can create a clause for each clause in the transform we are considering. To generate subproofs:

# If the clause makes a structural change, then add the entire proof obligation 
# If the clause makes a change //within// the constructor, and the constructor does not change, then add the partial derivatives w.r.t. the changed term in the proof term.
