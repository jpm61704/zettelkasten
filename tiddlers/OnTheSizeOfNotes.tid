From page 129 of [[ahrens2017how]], it is recommended to keep notes to the size of an A6 sheet of paper. This is about the size of a quarter of an 8.5x11 sheet of printer paper. On the computer, this basically means each note can be up to the size of the screen with no scrolling. This is about 300 words of lipsum on a 133% zoom on my laptop.
