For the purposes of static analysis, we interpret an $$\text{assert}$$ as a request to prove that some fact holds in a sub-heap at a program point, or more abstractly, that some fact holds over a data structure. Consider some property $$\hat a \cdot p$$, where $$a$$ is some pointer to the heap and $$p$$ is some property over the heap, defined in separation logic. Here we wish to verify that $$p$$ holds on the heap pointed to by $$\hat a$$ by unfolding the inductive structure(shape) of $$p$$ on $$\hat a$$.
